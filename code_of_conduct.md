## CS 4241 Discord: Code of Conduct

### Welcome!

The CS 4241 Discor server is intended for current students and instructors in CS 4241 @ WPI, in Fall of 2021.

The current admins are:

- Charlie Roberts 
- Mikel Matticoli
- Akim Ndlovu

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, 
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. 
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Discretion:

Please don't talk about discussions in this server in public. This is a private, invitation-only server. Please don't discuss it with people outside of WPI’s programs who are not members. 
Keeping the existence of this server private makes it more difficult for bad actors to triangulate their targets' social footprints.

### Confidentiality:

Please keep what's said in the server confidential. Don't repeat or quote things said without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s).

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. 
While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that
every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information 
that could harm you or others if it became public.

### Message Retention:

Discord is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. 
Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

### Harassment:

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion 
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. 
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names 
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate 
- Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop. 
- Threats of violence 
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm 
- Deliberate intimidation 
- Sustained disruption of discussion 
- Unwelcome sexual attention 
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease 
- Publication of non-harassing private communication 

### Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. 
They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

### Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion
from this Team and contacting appropriatet univeristy administrators.
